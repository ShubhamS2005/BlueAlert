BlueAlert ‚Äì Real-Time Coastal Hazard Monitoring System 

An Integrated Platform for Crowdsourced Ocean Hazard Reporting and Social Media Analytics


---

üìñ Overview

BlueAlert is a real-time coastal hazard monitoring platform designed to improve the safety and resilience of coastal communities.
The system enables citizens, authorities, and researchers to collaboratively detect, report, and analyze marine hazards such as tsunamis, storm surges, oil spills, and high waves.

By integrating IoT sensor data, crowdsourced citizen reports, and social media analytics, BlueAlert provides a unified platform for early warning, situational awareness, and decision support.

üéØ Objective

To develop a scalable and data-driven hazard intelligence platform that:

Collects real-time coastal hazard data through citizen participation and IoT devices.

Analyzes social media posts to identify hazard trends and public sentiment.

Supports decision-making for government agencies and coastal authorities.

Enhances early warning dissemination and community preparedness.

‚öô System Architecture

Core Components:

1. Mobile/Web Application: Enables users to report hazards with geolocation, images, and videos.


2. Backend Server: Handles data processing, validation, and database management.


3. IoT Integration Layer: Collects sensor data (sea level, weather, turbidity, etc.).


4. Analytics Engine: Performs sentiment analysis, trend detection, and visualization.


5. Admin Dashboard: Provides monitoring, data insights, and alert control for authorities.
